./quadrant_masks <procs_per_node> <cores_per_proc> <HT per mask>

./quadrant_masks 4 16 2

HT per mask determines how many HT cores are used in the mask.
With 1:
[ 1 - - - ]
2:
[ 1 - 1 - ]
3:
[ 1 1 1 - ]
4:
[ 1 1 1 1 ]

It is likely that 2 is the best choice for 1 or 2 threads per core, while 4 is the best for 4 threads per core.
3 is likely bad.  With 1 thread per core, 4 appears to add noise.
