The configure script will dump information before calling CMake. Inspect the
modules loaded to ensure it all looks normal.

You may need to edit configure-cori and towards the bottom change the cmake module
that is loaded (or remove the load all together). This was added to ensure that the same
Cmake version is always used.

To edit TPLs, you must edit configure-cori-cmake. The TPLs at the bottom with the actual
CMake command. The middle of script replicates the cmake call and echos this to stdout.
Ideally, all things would be set in variables, and then echoed and passed to cmake, but there
seems to be an issue with quoting, so currently the script replicates the commands.
